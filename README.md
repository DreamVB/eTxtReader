# eTxtReader
Ben's eTxt Reader and Compiler

This is a project that allows you to compile text or html files inta compressed package file that can be used for displaying custom help files for your software or if your building a book you wish to publish for windows.
The original idea came from when I made a simple file packer and my first idea for a project using it was to convert many text files into one and have one reader for it. 
But as the project grew I started adding features for html. The project is still not finished and still has a few things I like to add,
But for now it just does the trick any way hope you like it.
